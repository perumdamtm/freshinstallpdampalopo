Freshinstall installed iwd instead of networkmanager.Ends up configuring /etc/resolv.conf; /etc/iwd/main.conf; /etc/systemd/network/* using only cat and echo because I pacman -Rs vi wanted to change it to vim, problem with dhcp of ipv4. Regular stuff of freshinstall arch, enabling bunch of systemd services (e.g iwd.services, systemd-resolved, and systemd.networkd.service). Note: vi and w3m/lynx are important.
Added new user put on wheel group. Configured /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*. Use '$ systemctl edit getty@tty1.service --drop-in=autologin.conf to add getty@tty1.service.d/autologin.conf for autologin without login manager (should not be added manually.  Configured ~/.xinitrc to have setxkbmap -variant colemak; xset r66; xset r rate 191; xset s off -dpms. Added .bash_alias
